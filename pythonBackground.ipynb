    "3. Python is an interpreted language- Understand this concept\n",
    "4. Python can be run using shell and the IDE\n",
    "5. Python code often contains references to the comedy group Monty Python. This is why the words, \"spam\" and \"eggs\" are often used as placeholder variables in Python where \"foo\" and \"bar\" would be used in other programming languages.\n",
    "6. Computers can't store floats perfectly accurately, in the same way that we can't write down the complete decimal expansion of 1/3 (0.3333333333333333...). Keep this in mind, because it often leads to infuriating bugs!\n",

    "An important aspect of Python’s compilation to bytecode is that it’s entirely implicit. You never invoke a compiler, you simply run a .py file. The Python implementation compiles the files as needed. This is different than Java, for example, where you have to run the Java compiler to turn Java source into compiled class files. For this reason, Java is often called a compiled language, while Python is called an interpreted language. But both compile to bytecode, and then both execute the bytecode with a software implementation of a virtual machine."

This interactivity is usually missing in “compiled” languages, but even at the Python interactive prompt, your Python is compiled to bytecode, and then the bytecode is executed. This immediate execution, and Python’s lack of an explicit compile step, are why people call the Python executable “the Python interpreter."

PyPy is another implementation, using a JIT compiler to run code much faster than CPython can."
