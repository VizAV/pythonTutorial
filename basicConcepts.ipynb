    "1. Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. There is no need to compile your program before executing it.\n",
    "2. Code written for Python 3.x is guaranteed to work in all future versions. \n",
    "3. Python is an interpreted language- Understand this concept\n",
    "4. Python can be run using shell and the IDE\n",
    "5. Python code often contains references to the comedy group Monty Python. This is why the words, \"spam\" and \"eggs\" are often used as placeholder variables in Python where \"foo\" and \"bar\" would be used in other programming languages.\n",
    "6. Computers can't store floats perfectly accurately, in the same way that we can't write down the complete decimal expansion of 1/3 (0.3333333333333333...). Keep this in mind, because it often leads to infuriating bugs!\n",
    "7. Python silently converts the integer to a float.\n"

Create a string with three sets of quotes, and newlines that are created by pressing Enter are automatically escaped for you. This was we can print a complex formatted string with wrapping in a single print statement and not use separate print statements for newlines"
